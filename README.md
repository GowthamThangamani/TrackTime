## Overview
The **Activity Tracker** application monitors user activity by detecting input events (e.g., mouse/keyboard) and logs active time intervals. It also tracks idle occurrences based on a configurable threshold. The application supports viewing total logged time for any given date.

---

## Features
1. **Track Active Time**:
   - Logs the duration when the user is actively using the system.
   - Stops tracking after detecting prolonged inactivity.

2. **Idle Monitoring**:
   - Detects idle time based on a specified threshold (default: 5 minutes).

3. **Time Log Reports**:
   - Displays total active time per day.

4. **Log Storage**:
   - Records all active sessions in a text file (`activity_log.txt`) for persistent storage.

---

## How It Works
1. **Activity Detection**:
   - Uses the `GetLastInputInfo` function from the `user32.dll` library to detect the time of the last input event.
   - Calculates idle time by comparing the current time with the last input time.

2. **Session Tracking**:
   - Logs active time intervals and accumulates the total duration in memory.
   - Writes session data to `activity_log.txt` for each session.

3. **Command Interface**:
   - Options to **start tracking** and **view summary reports** in a simple text-based menu.

4. **Idle Count**:
   - Keeps track of how many times the user was idle beyond the threshold.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **.NET Framework or .NET Core SDK**: Required to compile and run the code.
- **Windows OS**: The program relies on `user32.dll`, which is available on Windows systems.

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/ActivityTracker.git
   cd ActivityTracker
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

3. Run the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## Usage

### Start Tracking Time
1. Select option **2: Record time** from the main menu.
2. Monitor active and idle time in real-time.
3. Press **'S'** to stop tracking and log the session.

### View Total Time
1. Select option **1: Show total time taken based on date** from the main menu.
2. View daily summaries of active time.
